Snowflakes gathered lightly on Greg Hill's jacketed shoulders as he broke trail on his skis, guiding our group up a mountain in British Columbia's Rogers Pass. It was February, prime time to experience this ski mecca, which lies less than 70km from the town of Revelstoke that Hill has called home for the last two and a half decades. Expounding on how our personal buying choices can make a difference in the fight against climate change, he paused to point with his ski pole at yet another dead pine tree.

"It seems like at least a quarter of the trees up here are dead now," he said, explaining how worsening pine beetle outbreaks are a sign of climate change, as winters haven't been cold enough or long enough to keep them out.

If it seemed like a pedantic conversation for a guided ski trip, it was intentional. This was day one of a unique new adventure; one of the most sustainable ski trips on offer right now in this era of conscious climate travel. Hill, also a professional athlete and activist known for walking the climate talk in the ski industry, offers the trips through the new site 57 Hours that connects adventure seekers with certified guides all over the world. He tailors four-day guided ski touring in Revelstoke's surrounding mountains complete with electric transportation, coordinates locally sourced meals and stays in greener accommodations, and – perhaps most critically – helps guests understand their own carbon footprint and teaches them how to lower it.

In 2010, Hill became famous for climbing and skiing two million vertical feet in a single year of ski touring, a feat that spanned 71 mountains across two hemispheres. He's set other vertical and speed records since. Along the way, though, a realisation formed: a widening gap yawned between the abundance he received from spending time in nature – joy, peace, exhilaration, balance, solitude – and how he approached nature.
